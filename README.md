# Hi there! I'm Juan👨‍🔬

I'm a Venezuelan software engineer and developer based in NYC. 

I love designing, and building systems, and software that helps people. I'm currently working at Infosys. There I spend my days making sure that the products I build are high quality and our users are receiving the experience that they deserve.
